UIx: The Future of UI Development
UIx is a revolutionary no-code/low-code platform that allows anyone to build fully functional and interactive user interfaces (UIs) without writing code.
Designed to streamline the process of UI development, 
UIx empowers designers,developers, and non-technical users to create visually stunning and 
responsive interfaces as easily as using modern graphic design tools like Canva, Figma, or GIMP.

Key Features that this project would have are-->

Drag-and-Drop UI Creation: Create beautiful and responsive user interfaces without writing a single line of code. Use the intuitive drag-and-drop editor to add buttons, forms, lists, menus, and more.
Fully Responsive: Instantly preview how your UI will look on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) and screen sizes.
Element Creation:Create any element using inbuilt tools or using one that are available in public
Backend Integration: Seamlessly connect your UI to backend services, databases, and APIs through a visual interface.
Collaboration-Friendly: UIx makes it easy for teams to work togetherâ€”designers can handle the visual aspects while developers can tweak the functionality, all within the same platform.
Custom Code Integration: For advanced users, UIx offers the ability to jump into the code at any time, allowing for deeper customization while still leveraging the visual tool.
